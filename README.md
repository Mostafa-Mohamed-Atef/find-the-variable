Find The Variable
This project is a simple python program that solves a problem I always faced in casio calculators, In older calculators which I have it takes so much time to find the unknown variable in your equation this code solve this problem by finding all types of equations in high speed (in the future i will add more complex equations)

Files
main.py: the main python code you can run it and write your function in terminal 
gui.py: the same code with more simple user interface 

Features
 -finds variable in any equation 
 -you can write any symbol you want ex: x, y, f, z
 -solves quadratic equations and gives both values 
 
Technologies Used
 -sympy: excellent module for solving complex math questions 
 -tkinter & ttkbootstrap: for user interface

To-Do for next level in the future:
  - when there are two values only one appears (SOLVED)
  - float values (SOLVED)
  - solving two unknown variables 
  - adding numpy for matrices and complex expressions
