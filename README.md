# Find The Variable

This project is a simple Python program that addresses a common problem with older Casio calculators: finding the unknown variable in an equation can be time-consuming. This code solves that problem by rapidly finding the unknown variable in various types of equations. Future updates will include support for more complex equations.

## Files

- **main.py**: The main Python code. Run this file and write your function in the terminal.
- **gui.py**: The same code but with a simpler user interface.

## Features

- Finds variables in any equation.
- Allows you to use any symbol for variables (e.g., x, y, f, z).
- Solves quadratic equations and provides both values.

## Technologies Used

- **SymPy**: An excellent module for solving complex math equations.
- **Tkinter & TtkBootstrap**: For the user interface.

## To-Do for Next Level

- Solving two unknown variables.
- Adding NumPy for matrices and complex expressions.

### Completed To-Dos

- Displaying both values when there are two solutions.
- Handling float values.
